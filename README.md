Setting Up the Project
To start, the project was structured into different modules for better maintainability. The database is managed using SQLAlchemy, while NeonDB (a cloud-based PostgreSQL database) is used for persistent storage. Using NeonDB ensures the application remains scalable and can handle concurrent requests efficiently. The database connection is managed using SessionLocal, which ensures that each request gets a fresh session, preventing conflicts or stale connections.

Building the API Endpoints
The application revolves around user management and matching users based on shared interests. Key endpoints include:

Creating a User: The POST /users/ endpoint allows new users to be added. Data validation ensures that required fields like name, age, email, and interests are provided before storing them in the database.
Retrieving Users: The GET /users/ endpoint supports pagination to fetch users efficiently without overwhelming the database.
Fetching a Single User: The GET /users/{user_id} endpoint retrieves a specific user, returning a 404 Not Found error if the user does not exist.
Updating a User: The PUT /users/{user_id} endpoint supports partial updates, meaning only the fields that need to be changed are updated rather than overwriting the entire record.
Deleting a User: The DELETE /users/{user_id} endpoint allows users to be removed from the system permanently.
Matching Users: The GET /users/{user_id}/matches endpoint is where things get interesting. It finds users in the same city who share at least one common interest. This was implemented using SQLAlchemy’s overlap function, ensuring efficient matching even with large datasets.
Testing the API
FastAPI’s interactive API documentation (http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs and http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) was extremely useful for testing the endpoints. These auto-generated docs made it easy to send requests and verify responses. For more detailed testing, Postman was used to simulate real-world scenarios, while pytest was set up for automated testing.

I personally found FastAPI's built-in validation and interactive documentation to be a game-changer. It eliminated the need for manually writing extensive test cases just to check if the API structure was working correctly. Using Postman for manual testing also helped catch edge cases, ensuring that inputs were validated properly before reaching the database.
